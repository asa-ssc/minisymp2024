          in the social, environmental and health sciences. An elected member of the U.S. National Academy
          of Sciences, he was identified as the world's most cited researcher in mathematics for the
          decade 1995-2005 by Thomson-ISI. He has supervised 34 Ph.D. graduates, of whom 21 hold or have
          held tenure-track university faculty positions [Extended Bio](https://sites.stat.washington.edu/raftery/bio.html).
    - Title: Statistical Inference with Model Uncertainty
    - Abstract: Choosing a statistical model and accounting for uncertainty about this choice
      are important parts of the scientific process and are required for common statistical
      tasks such as parameter estimation, interval estimation, statistical inference, point
      prediction, and interval prediction. A canonical example is the choice of variables in
      a linear regression model. Many ways of doing this have been proposed, including Bayesian
      and penalized regression methods, and it is not clear which are best. We compare 21 popular
      methods via an extensive simulation study based on a wide range of real datasets. We found that
      three adaptive Bayesian model averaging methods performed best across all the statistical tasks
      and that two of these were also among the most computationally efficient. We also compared
      different priors on model space. Finally we addressed the question of whether model averaging
      provides an advantage over model selection. This is joint work with Anupreet Porwal.

	<details><summary>Enhancing Statistical Computing Education through Game
	Plans: A Pedagogical Approach</summary>
	In statistical computing education, students often grapple with the
	transition from conceptualizing a data task, such as data wrangling or
	visualization, to writing the necessary code. While students likely have the
	original data set and a vision of the desired outcome, we need to teach
	students how to translate a general task (e.g., add a variable, combine two
	data sets, summarize groups, create a visualization, etc.) into appropriate
	(and correctly ordered) lines of code. Further, as tasks get more
	complicated and datasets get larger, this translation between the data task
	and code becomes increasingly difficult. Drawing from computer science
	education literature, which advocates breaking down steps of complex
	problem-solving tasks and writing about code (Catrambone, 2011), we
	introduced “game planning” into four sections of introductory statistical
	computing that focus on the tidyverse in R. Game plans serve as strategic
	guides that prompt students to map their coding strategies before
	implementation. Students can create game plans in various formats, such as
	pen-and-paper or digital tools like the online whiteboard Excalidraw. Our
	presentation explores the rationale behind game plans, showcases diverse
	student approaches, and provides practical tools and examples, all aimed at
	improving students’ proficiency and structured thinking in statistical
	computing.
