	<details><summary>Enhancing Statistical Computing Education through Game
	Plans: A Pedagogical Approach</summary>
	In statistical computing education, students often grapple with the
	transition from conceptualizing a data task, such as data wrangling or
	visualization, to writing the necessary code. While students likely have the
	original data set and a vision of the desired outcome, we need to teach
	students how to translate a general task (e.g., add a variable, combine two
	data sets, summarize groups, create a visualization, etc.) into appropriate
	(and correctly ordered) lines of code. Further, as tasks get more
	complicated and datasets get larger, this translation between the data task
	and code becomes increasingly difficult. Drawing from computer science
	education literature, which advocates breaking down steps of complex
	problem-solving tasks and writing about code (Catrambone, 2011), we
	introduced “game planning” into four sections of introductory statistical
	computing that focus on the tidyverse in R. Game plans serve as strategic
	guides that prompt students to map their coding strategies before
	implementation. Students can create game plans in various formats, such as
	pen-and-paper or digital tools like the online whiteboard Excalidraw. Our
	presentation explores the rationale behind game plans, showcases diverse
	student approaches, and provides practical tools and examples, all aimed at
	improving students’ proficiency and structured thinking in statistical
	computing.
